Great! To write tailored **About** content for your Django/PostgreSQL data analytics dashboard, I‚Äôll need a few key pieces of information. Here's a checklist ‚Äî you can copy/paste and fill in as much as you're ready to share:

---

### üîπ General Info

1. **App Name** (if any): 
2. **Brief One-Liner** (how would you describe the app in 1 sentence?):
3. **What kind of users is this dashboard for?** (e.g., internal staff, clients, general public) 
4. **Main use case / problem it solves:** 

---

### üîπ Technical Details

5. **Tech Stack** (you mentioned Django, PostgreSQL ‚Äì anything else? Like JS framework, charting libs, Celery, Docker, etc.):
6. **Data Source(s)** ‚Äì where is the data coming from? 
7. **Key Features / Modules** (e.g., filterable charts, user auth, export to CSV, scheduled reports): 
8. **Is it deployed live?** (if yes, include the URL or just say where it's hosted: Heroku, Vercel, etc.) 

---

### üîπ Visuals / UX

9. **Design approach** (clean and minimal? themed? Bootstrap or Tailwind? Custom design?) 
10. **Any standout features or user interactions?** (e.g., drill-downs, animations, mobile-responsive layout) 

---

### üîπ GitHub README-Specific

11. **Install instructions** ‚Äî do you want these included? Do you have a `requirements.txt` or Dockerfile? 

---

### üîπ Portfolio-Specific

12. **What do you want to emphasize in your portfolio?** (e.g., problem-solving, code architecture, business impact, UX decisions) 
13. **Any challenges or accomplishments you're proud of?** 
14. **Would you like a call-to-action at the end?** (e.g., ‚ÄúContact me to learn more,‚Äù or ‚ÄúView the source code‚Äù) 

---

Once I have your answers, I‚Äôll give you:

* ‚úÖ A **popup modal version** (\~100‚Äì150 words, friendly but informative)
* ‚úÖ A **README.md** (standard format, install/setup/use, features, screenshots section)
* ‚úÖ A **portfolio writeup** (detailed, narrative-style, suited for a personal website with optional visual aids)

Feel free to answer just a few at a time if you‚Äôre still working out some details.


AppName: EconomIQ
Brief-one-liner: you make it up from the rest of this description
who it's for: this is just a project dashboard meant to showcase my application development and data analytic skills using python matplotlib mplfinance pandas sklearn numpy django and postgres. it's meant for an employer that may be interested in hiring me, tho I don't think we can just kind of put it in those terms so you can come up with something better. 

this dashboard uses data visualization tools to analyze a postgres database hosted on supabase. the database is dummy data of economic indicators "column_name"
"Date"
"GDP Growth (%)"
"Inflation Rate (%)"
"Unemployment Rate (%)"
"Interest Rate (%)"
"Consumer Confidence Index"
"id"
"usd_eur_rate"
"usd_jpy_rate"
"crude_oil_price"
"gold_price"
"bankruptcy_rate"
"mna_deals_volume"
"vc_funding_volume"
"corporate_profits"
"consumer_spending"
"retail_sales" that closely models real data gotten from OpenAI. so in a real world scenario this could be used to visualize data to drive decision makeing.

I used python, django, postgres, supabase, matplotlib mplfinance pandas sklearn numpy, hosted on heroku

data is fetched from the database on supabase through psycopg2 using database models built by running inspectdb

features filterable charts, users can select what datasource they want to see the data visualization from for example market analysis user can pick from dow jones nasdaq and s&p500 and choose to see vwap ema and sma or regression, and so on. 

it's hosted on Heroku economiq.gerardosanchez.dev

I used a combination of custom CSS and Bootstrap 

it has a responsive responive navmenu

I will add a requirements file

for the portfolio I want it to be balanced I don't think I want to emphasize one thing over another but probably the standout feature is the data analytic layer that creates the charts and analayzes the data. the layout and ux is not particularly impressive or heavily emphasized. the landing page provides a broad economic overview where the user can select up to 2 metrics to chart and compare on the main chart (GDP Growth, CPI inflation, unemployment rate, fed funds rate, consumer confidence) and choose resolution by timeframe. Then there's a radar graph that shows yearly economic shifts with the mentioned metrics graphed. then we have a market analysis page with a chart described earlier. There's an economic composition over time graph that shows a normalized stackchart with gdp growth inflation uneployment ande interested rate a share of total contribution. then an investment signals page with an investment climate index by vc funding and corporate profits, and another chart with currency and commodity price analysis 

Finding the data was challenging. I looked at Kaggle for datasets but they were either outdated and/or innacurate, and it took some work to figure out whether the data was accurate or not and I decided to use OpenAI to produce real-ish looking data just so I could put the project together. the chats ended up looking good and the fact the user can select what they want from the chart and have it appear without page refresh is a good user experienc which was accomplished with good use of javascript. I would have used ajax but it proved unnecessary. 

Yea, let's add a view source code
